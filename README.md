# RotisserieNotification
A script for notifications and card validation of rotisserie drafts using google sheets

Sheet used for drafting is found here (you must make your own copy of it)

After copying the sheet, read the HowTo tab in the sheet for how to set up the notification-script, and how to start a draft :)
